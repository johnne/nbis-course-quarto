## Usage

This presentation uses the following document yaml header:

```yaml
---
title: "nbis-course-revealjs example"
subtitle: How to write a revealjs presentation
footer: NBIS course
author: John Doe
institute: NBIS
date: today
format: nbis-course-revealjs
---
```

Notice that the title page includes a NBIS/SciLifeLab logo.

## Home icon plugin (WIP)

The extensions provides a home icon that is placed in the bottom left
corner of each slide. The home icon is a customizable link that could
could point to, e.g., the course home page.

The plugin can be activated and customized by adding the following to
the document yaml header:

```yaml
format:
  nbis-course-revealjs:
    nbis-home:
      url: https://nbis.se
revealjs-plugins:
  - nbis-home
```

## Color customizations

Theme colors are used to colorize elements, including:

- **strong**

- blockquotes

    > This is a quote

- code

```python
import numpy as np
```

- links: [nbis](https://nbis.se/)

## Custom blocks

FIXME: this currently does not work in revealjs format.
