```yaml
---
title: "nbis-course-revealjs example"
subtitle: How to write a revealjs presentation
footer: NBIS course
author: John Doe
institute: NBIS
date: today
format: nbis-course-revealjs
---
```

Notice that the title page includes a NBIS/SciLifeLab logo.

## Home icon

WIP: customizable home icon

At the bottom of each slide there is a home icon that currently points
to <https://nbis.se>. The intention is to make it customizable such
that it could point to, e.g., the course home page.

## Color customizations

Some elements are typeset in special colors, such as:

- **strong**

- blockquotes

    > This is a quote

- code

```python
import numpy as np
```

- links: [nbis](https://nbis.se/)

## Custom blocks

FIXME: this currently does not work in revealjs format.
